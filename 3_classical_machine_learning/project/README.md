# unit3_Project
## Project Overview 
Hepatitis C is a viral infection that causes liver inflammation, sometimes leading to serious liver damage. The hepatitis C virus (HCV) spreads through contaminated blood.
The infection was one of the main death causes from 1960 to 1970. 
In this project we will be studying a dataset of Hepatitis C infection. The dataset was donated by the Medical University Hannover (MHH); Hannover, Germany.

You will walk through an example containing some data preparation , classification task and a clustering task to end up with a conclusion part where you will be comparing the two methods and providing explanation about the observed phenomenon.

You will have enough guidance throughout the project sections and this project will be graded and reviewed by a teacher assistant as well as the chance for you to reach out to the TA via slack whenever you feel you are stuck.

The key is to know that the best way to learn is the hardest! :)

## Details :
You will be using the [HCV data Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/HCV+data#). 
- The project is divided into 4 notebooks at the end of each you will be saving a results file (except for the final notebook).
- The first notebook will be tackeling the data cleaning and preparation.
- The second notebook will be dedicated to the unsupervised learning task.
- The third notebook will be dedicated to the supervised learning task.
- The final notebook will be dedicated to your final analysis and conclusions.

Make sure to follow the instuctions in each notebook and **comment and explain your steps and analysis**
